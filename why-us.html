                    <h2>The Lejit Drywall Quality Difference</h2>
                    <p>
                        Many contractors can hang drywall. Far fewer can deliver the flawless finish that transforms
                        a space. Here's what makes our work exceptional:
                    </p>

                    <h4>Superior Materials</h4>
                    <p>
                        We use only premium-grade drywall, tape, mud, and fasteners. Quality materials are the
                        foundation of quality results, and we never cut corners to save a few dollars.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Master-Level Finishing</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our finishers have decades of combined experience creating perfectly smooth, seamless surfaces.
                        Multiple coats applied with precision, sanded to perfection, and inspected rigorously.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Attention to Detail</h4>
                    <p>
                        From the first measurement to the final inspection, we obsess over details. Square corners,
                        invisible seams, and smooth surfaces that look perfect from every angle.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Clean Worksite</h4>
                    <p>
                        Drywall work creates dust, but we minimize mess with proper containment, daily cleanup,
                        and thorough final cleaning. We leave your space cleaner than we found it.
                    </p>
